# Running the analysis

First, run code/processing_code/processingscript.R, which contains dataset loading, cleaning up and exploratory analysis.
Then, run code/processing_code/analysis_code/analysisscript.R, which performs the modeling analysis.
Finally, knit products/manuscript/Manuscript.Rmd to get the final manuscript.
