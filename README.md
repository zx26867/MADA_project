# Overview

The dataset I obtained is from kaggle. It is a chemical dataset of wines. The variables contain:
0 - wine type
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol

1 - 11 are all numeric variables. The only categorical variable is the wine type: red/white. 

My Questions:
1. Is it possible to predict the wine type based on these chemical levels?
2. Given I have almost no concept about wine, with this dataset provided, am I able to tell the key chemicals that distinguish the red wine from the white wine?
